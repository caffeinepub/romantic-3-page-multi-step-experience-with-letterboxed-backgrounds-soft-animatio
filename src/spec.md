# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update Page 1 (IntroPage) colors to specific hex values for the heading, body text, and CTA background.

**Planned changes:**
- Change the IntroPage main heading text color to exactly `#722F37` (wine) using a Tailwind arbitrary color (or equivalent).
- Change the IntroPage main body paragraph text color to exactly `#E8E8E8` (unicorn silver) using a Tailwind arbitrary color (or equivalent).
- Update the IntroPage clickable CTA box background color to be based on exactly `#669966` (thyme), while preserving existing opacity/alpha behavior and existing hover/transition behavior.

**User-visible outcome:** On Page 1, the heading and paragraph display in the requested exact colors, and the CTA box shows the updated thyme-based background color while still behaving the same (hover/transition) and navigating to the next page when clicked.
