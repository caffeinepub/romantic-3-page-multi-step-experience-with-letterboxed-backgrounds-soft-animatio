# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Improve readability on the Final page, slightly reduce the YES button size, and restyle the intro gate screen with a love/Valentine theme while keeping existing navigation and behavior.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the /final page long message and signature to render as solid pure white; remove the shimmer/shine effect from the message while preserving the existing fonts and line breaks.
- Make the /proposal “YES” button slightly smaller (padding and/or font size) while keeping the same romantic styling and hover/transition behavior; keep YES navigation to /final unchanged.
- Restyle the pre-Page-1 “Enter the Website” gate screen with romantic/love colors and visible animated heart effects on desktop and mobile, without changing the click/tap-to-enter behavior or the existing 3-page flow.

**User-visible outcome:** The Final page text is clearly readable in pure white, the YES button looks slightly smaller but behaves the same, and the entry gate feels Valentine-themed with animated hearts while still requiring a tap/click to enter.
