  "summary": "Diff implements autoplay attempt on mount, adds a play retry on the existing \"Enter the Website\" gesture, and adds console diagnostics around audio loading/play. However, the diff does not provide LLM-readable evidence that the runtime audio file is the user-provided \"Soch_Na_Sake_FULL....\" track, nor that duplicate audio variants were avoided/removed. Route-persistence via App.tsx cannot be confirmed from the provided diff snippets.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-5",
      "requirement": "Use the provided audio track file \"Soch_Na_Sake_FULL....\" as the app’s background music by adding it to `frontend/public/assets/` and ensuring the runtime audio source points to that exact file (or replace `/assets/background-music.mp3` while keeping that path working).",
      "reason": "No new asset file was added (Added: 0), and the provider still points to `/assets/background-music.mp3`. The diff does not include evidence that `frontend/public/assets/background-music.mp3` was replaced with the user-provided \"Soch_Na_Sake_FULL....\" content or that a file with that exact name was added and referenced.",

      "id": "REQ-7",
      "requirement": "Ensure the audio element is created and used reliably across route changes via the existing `BackgroundAudioProvider` integration in `frontend/src/App.tsx` (so route navigation does not restart the track).",
      "reason": "While `BackgroundAudioProvider` creates a single audio element in a mount-only effect, the diff does not show `frontend/src/App.tsx` (or any routing/root composition code) to confirm the provider is mounted above the router and is not remounted on route transitions.",

      "id": "REQ-8",
      "requirement": "Avoid duplicate audio copies: include only one background music file in `frontend/public/assets/` for runtime use and remove/avoid adding multiple variants of the same track.",
      "reason": "The diff shows no added/removed asset files (Added: 0, Removed: 0) and does not provide a verifiable listing of audio assets under `frontend/public/assets/` to confirm that only one source-of-truth music file ships and no duplicates exist.",
