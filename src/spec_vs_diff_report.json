      "requirement": "Replace the app’s three page background assets by copying/renaming the user-uploaded images into the expected static asset filenames under frontend/public/assets/generated/ (bg-page-1.dim_1920x1080.png, bg-page-2.dim_1920x1080.png, bg-page-3.dim_1920x1080.png) so Page 1–3 show the new images with existing contain/letterbox + overlay behavior unchanged.",
