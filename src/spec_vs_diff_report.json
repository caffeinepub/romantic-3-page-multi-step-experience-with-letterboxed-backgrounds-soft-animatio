  "summary": "Diff shows the song picker UI was moved to a fixed top-left position with an English \"Choose Song\" label and added local-file validation/status display. No diff evidence shows the default background-music.mp3 asset being replaced/updated or any autoplay attempt/fallback behavior being implemented/changed.",

      "requirement": "Set the default background music to the uploaded track starting with \"Soch Na Sake\" by making it the runtime default audio asset at `frontend/public/assets/background-music.mp3`, keep the local file picker, and show an English status message instructing the user to choose a song if the default asset cannot be loaded.",
      "reason": "No diff evidence of updating/replacing `frontend/public/assets/background-music.mp3`, setting the default source to `/assets/background-music.mp3`, or implementing the specific \"default audio unavailable\" status messaging behavior.
